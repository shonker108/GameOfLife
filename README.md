# Game of Life simulator

It's my implementation of the famous Conway's Game of Life.

Controls:
* D - Turn on/off debug mode (predict next alive cells of the next generation (ðŸŸ¢)and count neighboors for every cell (ðŸ”´ - problem caused by font?))
* G - Turn on/off grid
* R - Restart grid (clean from alive cells)
* Space - Turn on/off simulation (it's stopped by default)
